Here's a **`README.md`** template for a GitHub repository focused on implementing and understanding the Bloom Filter algorithm:

# 🌼 Bloom Filter Algorithm

A **Bloom Filter** is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure designed to test whether an element is a member of a set. While it can determine if an element is *definitely not* in the set, it may yield false positives for elements that *might be* in the set. This repository contains an implementation of the Bloom Filter algorithm and explanations of its workings.

## 🚀 Features

- **Space-efficient**: Compact representation of large datasets.
- **Fast Operations**: Quickly insert and query elements.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust false positive rates and memory usage.
- **Python Implementation**: Includes an easy-to-understand implementation with comments.

## 📖 Understanding Bloom Filters

A Bloom Filter consists of:

1. **Bit Array**: A large array of bits initialized to 0.
2. **Hash Functions**: A set of independent hash functions that map elements to positions in the bit array.

### Operations

1. **Insert an Element**:
   - Pass the element through each hash function.
   - Set the bit at each resulting position in the bit array to 1.

2. **Query an Element**:
   - Pass the element through the same hash functions.
   - Check the bits at the corresponding positions in the array.
   - If any of the bits are 0, the element is *definitely not* in the set.
   - If all bits are 1, the element *might be* in the set.

### Key Characteristics

- **No False Negatives**: If the filter says an element is not in the set, it’s guaranteed to be correct.
- **False Positives**: An element might be reported as in the set even when it isn’t.

## 🛠️ Customization

Modify the parameters in `bloom_filter.py` to adjust:

- **Size of the Bit Array**: Larger arrays reduce false positive rates.
- **Number of Hash Functions**: More functions improve accuracy but increase processing time.
